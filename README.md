# Project: Apply Filters to SQL Queries  

**Linux & SQL ‚Äì February 2025**  

---

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL filters can be applied to investigate suspicious activity in system logs.  
The focus is on learning how to use **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** operators to filter information in SQL queries.  

In this scenario, I worked with the `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables to identify potential security incidents, such as failed login attempts occurring outside of normal business hours.  

This work can be included in a professional cybersecurity portfolio to highlight my SQL investigation skills for recruiters and future employers.

## üéØ Scenario
You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your responsibilities is to monitor and investigate unusual login behavior.  

Recently, there was a concern about failed login attempts occurring after normal business hours.  
To investigate, I used SQL to filter and retrieve relevant information from the database tables.

## Part 1: Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts  

### üìù Task
Query the `log_in_attempts` table to identify all **failed login attempts** that happened **after 18:00 (6:00 PM)**.

### üñ•Ô∏è SQL Query
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00'
AND (success = 0 OR success = FALSE);

```
### Part 2: Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates  

### üìù Task  
A suspicious event occurred on **2022-05-09**. To investigate, I needed to review all login attempts that occurred on that day **and the day before (2022-05-08)**.

### üñ•Ô∏è SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09'
   OR login_date = '2022-05-08';


```

## Part 3: Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico  

### üìù Task  
There has been suspicious activity with login attempts, but the team determined that this activity did **not** originate in Mexico.  
To investigate, I needed to review all login attempts that occurred **outside of Mexico**.  

The `country` column contains values such as `MEX` or `MEXICO`. To filter all non-Mexico attempts, I used the **NOT** operator along with the **LIKE** keyword.

### üñ•Ô∏è SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%';

## Part 4: Retrieve Employees in Marketing  

### üìù Task  
The security team wants to perform updates on specific employee machines in the **Marketing department**.  
My responsibility was to query the `employees` table to identify all Marketing employees who work in the **East building**.  

The `department` column contains values that include "Marketing", and the `office` column contains office locations like `East-170` or `East-320`.  
To capture all Marketing employees in East offices, I used the **LIKE** operator with `%`.  

### üñ•Ô∏è SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing'
  AND office LIKE 'East-%';
